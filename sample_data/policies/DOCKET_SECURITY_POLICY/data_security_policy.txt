All sensitive data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit. We use industry-standard AES-256 encryption for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit.

Access to sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel only, following the principle of least privilege. Multi-factor authentication is required for all administrative access.

- Contain the breach
- Assess the impact
- Notify relevant authorities within 72 hours
- Notify affected individuals as required by regulations

4. RISK ASSESSMENT

The organization conducts quarterly risk assessments to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. Results are documented and reviewed by the Security Committee.

All security policies, procedures, and controls are documented in the company's security management system. This documentation is reviewed and updated annually.

6. COMPLIANCE MONITORING

Regular audits are conducted to ensure compliance with this policy and all applicable regulations. Non-compliance issues are escalated to department managers for remediation.
