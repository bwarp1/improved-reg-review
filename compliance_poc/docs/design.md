# AI-Driven Regulatory Compliance Analysis PoC - Design Document

## System Architecture

This proof-of-concept (PoC) tool follows a modular pipeline architecture to extract regulatory requirements from official documents and compare them against internal policies.

### Core Modules

1. **API Integration (`src/api/`)**: 
   - Fetches regulatory documents from Regulations.gov using their REST API
   - Handles authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
   - Downloads and manages document attachments

2. **NLP Processing (`src/nlp/`)**: 
   - Extracts text from various document formats (PDF, HTML, text)
   - Identifies regulatory obligations using rule-based NLP
   - Structures extracted obligations with metadata

3. **Policy Management (`src/policy/`)**: 
   - Loads and preprocesses internal policy documents
   - Creates searchable indexes for comparison

4. **Matching Engine (`src/matching/`)**: 
   - Compares regulatory obligations against policy content
   - Uses multiple matching approaches (keyword, fuzzy, semantic)
   - Scores and ranks potential matches

5. **Reporting (`src/reporting/`)**: 
   - Generates structured compliance reports
   - Supports multiple output formats (console, CSV, HTML)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Pipeline Architecture

The system uses a pipeline architecture where each stage can function independently. This enables:
- Easy extension or replacement of individual components
- Clean separation of concerns
- Better testability

### 2. Multiple Matching Strategies

The comparison engine uses three complementary approaches:
- **Direct keyword matching**: Fast, high-precision but limited recall
- **Fuzzy string matching**: Better for catching typos and minor variations
- **Semantic similarity**: Captures conceptual matches even with different wording

These are applied in sequence for optimal accuracy and performance.

### 3. Rule-Based Obligation Extraction

Instead of using a more complex machine learning approach, we use rule-based NLP for obligation extraction:
- Pattern matching on modal verbs ("shall", "must") and keywords
- Dependency parsing to identify the subject and action of each obligation
- Named entity recognition for contextual awareness

This approach offers:
- Transparency and explainability
- No need for labeled training data
- Adequate precision for the PoC stage

### 4. Configurable Thresholds

The system uses configurable thresholds for:
- Fuzzy match acceptance (how close strings need to be)
- Semantic similarity scores (minimum similarity required)
- Compliance classification (what constitutes "compliant" vs. "partial")

These can be tuned based on risk tolerance and domain-specific needs.

## Data Flow

1. User provides regulation identifier and internal policy location
2. System fetches regulation documents from Regulations.gov
3. NLP module extracts obligations from regulatory text
4. Policy documents are loaded and indexed
5. Each regulatory obligation is compared against relevant policy sections
6. Results are compiled into a compliance matrix
7. Report is generated in the requested format

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

- Limited to text-based analysis (no image processing)
- No context awareness across document sections
- Rule-based extraction may miss complex or implied obligations
- Limited handling of cross-references and dependencies between requirements

### Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Models**: Train domain-specific models for more accurate obligation extraction
- **Automated Policy Updates**: Suggest specific policy changes to address gaps
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Create a UI for exploring compliance status
- **Integration with GRC Tools**: Connect with existing governance, risk, and compliance systems
- **Version Control**: Track changes in regulations and policies over time
- **Broader Regulatory Coverage**: Expand to multiple regulatory domains
